# OIM3640 Project Proposal
Gabriel Rahardja and Julia Zlatin

## The Big Idea
The main idea of our project is to help ourselves and others understand gender bias at the job description level. We will develop a tool where users can select an industry from a drop-down menu. This tool will help users understand whether a specific industry uses more masculine or feminine language based on a sample of job descriptions per industry. When an industry is selected, a user will be led to a page with some statistics from our analysis.
 
Our minimum viable product will include a sample of sixteen total job descriptions across four industries (technology, finance, fashion, or beauty). This web application will be well-formatted and easy to use. A stretch goal is to look into six industries with a larger sample size of job descriptions. The stretch goal for our web application is that we will incorporate more application design best practices to create a more professional-looking UX and UI.
 
## Learning Goals
We want to learn if women in tech and finance roles have to adjust to communication standards to that of older, white men who currently lead these firms. We are also looking to understand if the fashion and beauty industries are more tailored to qualities associated with femininity. By gaining knowledge of gender bias at the job description level, we can become advocates to help foster more equal workplaces upon graduation. We ultimately want to help others understand more about gender discrimination to provide women and non-heteronormative men more an opportunity to thrive in the workplace.
 
As for our programming and software design goals, we want to use the materials we learned in class to make a usable web application with an accurate analysis. We are excited to learn how to develop a project from the planning through end product stages that we will feel proud to share with others.
 
## Implementation Plan
To implement our project, we will:
Create text files with masculine and feminine keywords
Web scrape LinkedIn job descriptions using the beautifulsoup module
Perform summary statistics 
Use TF-IDF for word frequency analysis
Import the Pandas and Numpy or Matplotlib modules to develop graphs
Use Flask for the web framework
Develop the web application using HTML and CSS
 
## Project Schedule
Week 1 (4/11):
Complete sourcing data
Complete Python code
Week 2 (4/18):
Complete web framework
Complete web app template
Week 3 (4/25):
Create User Instructions/README
Deploy project to Heroku
 
## Collaboration Plan
Our collaboration plan is to split up some of the more straightforward parts of the work and pair program the more difficult sections. For instance, one member will web scrape the data, while the other will perform some basic summary statistics. We will pair program the word frequency analysis by switching off who is driving the code and navigating the code every so often.
 
We also plan on using the Scrum framework to work on the deliverables we plan to do independently. We will split up the work into three categories: “to be done,” “doing,” and “done.” Each task will start on the backlog, and as we choose to mark a task as complete, it will be moved to that section of the Scrum board. When one of us completes a task, we will review the work together and decide if it is sufficient or needs more work. 
 
## Risks
One risk is that some gender-coded keywords can be hard to distinguish. Another risk is that there is a lot of learning involved in this project. We both have never used TF-IDF before, so we hope that this analysis will be challenging enough to learn and develop according to our timeline. It is also risky to use web scraping rather than scraping with an API, as we are not entirely familiar with the process and recognize that it may be more difficult.
 
## Additional Course Content
Some topics that we covered in class that are especially relevant to our project are:
Text analysis
Data types and structures
Web Scraping
Flask
HTML
